## Documentation

If the client's current time matches the site's time then only one clock will be shown and it won't have a label in front of it.

If the two times are different then two clocks will be shown, labelled as "Site Time" and "Local Time".

The datetime format of the clocks is dynamic based on the user's "Time format" setting (24-hour clock or 12-hour clock) found in the Administration dashboard under Personal > Settings.
