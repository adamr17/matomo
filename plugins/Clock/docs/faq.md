## FAQ

__I see a single clock being displayed by the widget. Is that in my timezone or in the site's timezone?__

If only one clock is being shown then the widget has detected that your local time is the same as the site's configured time.

__I see two clocks being displayed by the widget. What time is being shown on each of the clocks?__

The top clock, labelled "Site Time", is showing the time that matches your site's timezone configuration.

The bottom clock, labelled "Local Time", is showing your own local time (or whatever time your computer is set to).

For example, if your site is configured to the Toronto timezone and you are located in Vancouver, the top clock will show the current time in Toronto while the bottom clock will show the current time in Vancouver.

__The clock is showing the time in 12-hour or 24-hour format. How can I change it to the opposite format?__

The time format of the clock is based on your "Time format" setting. This setting can be found in the Administration dashboard under <i>Personal > Settings</i>.
